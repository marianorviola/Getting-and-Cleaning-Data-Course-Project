This repository is by Mariano Viola’s submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Week 4. It contains instructions on how to run the analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset

Files

•	A code book that describes the variables, the data and any work done to clean up the data.

•	A file “run_analysis.R” that performs the data preparation followed by the 5 steps described in the Project definition:
Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
Step 5: Create a second tidy data set (from the data set in Step 4), with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

•	“data_tidy.txt” is the exported final data after completing the sequences described above.
